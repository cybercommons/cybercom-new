cyberCommons Contributors
------------------------
The original cybercommons framework was funded by the National Science Foundation(NSF) through the Oklahoma EPSCoR Track-II RII (
`EPS-0919466 <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0919443>`_
) grant. The grant focused on creating a cyberCommons, a powerful, integrated cyber environment for knowledge discovery and education across complex environmental phenomena. Specifically, the cyberCommons will integrate two frameworksâ€” the science framework of data, models, analytics and narratives, and the cyberinfrastructure framework of hardware, software, collaboration environment and integration environment. The current cybercommons platform has evolved and is used in production for research and automating workflows including [The Oklahoma Water Survey](http://data.oklahomawatersurvey.org/portal/), [The Oklahoma Biological Survey](http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/), [The Totally Awesome Geolocator Service](http://tags.animalmigration.org/) (TAGS), [The Earth Observation Modeling facility](http://eomf.ou.edu/), [MGMIC](http://mgmic.oscer.ou.edu/) (MetaGenome analysis for Microbiologically Influenced Corrosion Studies),[The South Central Climate Sciences Center](http://southcentralclimate.org/), [University of Oklahoma Libraries](https://libraries.ou.edu/) at the University of Oklahoma.
