cyberCommons History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The original cyberCommons framework was funded by the National Science
Foundation(NSF) through the Oklahoma EPSCoR Track-II RII
(`EPS-0919466 <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0919443>`__
grant. The grant focused on creating a cyberCommons, a powerful,
integrated cyber environment for knowledge discovery and education
across complex environmental phenomena. Specifically, the cyberCommons
will integrate two frameworksâ€” the science framework of data, models,
analytics and narratives, and the cyberinfrastructure framework of
hardware, software, collaboration environment and integration
environment. The current cyberCommons platform has evolved and is used
in production for research and automating workflows including:

The cyberCommons Framework currently deployed across a wide variety of environments.
